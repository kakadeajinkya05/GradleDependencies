How to get Gradle Dependencies
1.	Make sure you have groovy installed and set in your PATH variable.
2.	Clone the folder and add your pom.xml in same folder.
3.	Go to that folder and run ‘groovy pom.groovy‘ into command prompt which will convert your pom.xml dependencies to build.gradle dependencies. 
4.	Copy that dependencies from command prompt and add to your build.gradle.
